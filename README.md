# MurderProject - This project is still currently in progress

#### General Important notes: creating a GitHub is also its own work in progress
#### While I do view myself as somewhat proficient in terms of navigating SQL, I fully believe there is still a wealth of opportunity for me to explore within SQL, particularly with Subqueries and answering interview style questions which will be an additional branch to this project repository.
#### It is also important to note that while DBA is a topic I am passionate about and would love to explore more of, the roles I am currently pursuing are ones where I would hold more scope over retrieving data versus setting up the skeleton.
